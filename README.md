autoUpdateUbuntu Project

This project helps to automatically update and maintain Ubuntu systems. In this repository, you'll find a script that performs automatic updates on your system every time you log in. This guide will walk you through the steps to create your own Git repository and push your code to GitHub.
How to Set Up the Repository

Follow these steps to set up a Git repository locally and push it to GitHub.
1. Create a Local Git Repository

    Navigate to your project folder where your code is located:

    Open the terminal and use the cd command to go to the directory where your project files are:

cd /path/to/your/project

Initialize a Git repository:

Run the following command to initialize the repository:

    git init

    This command creates a .git folder in your directory, making it a Git repository.

2. Add Your Files to the Repository

    Add your files to the staging area:

    After initializing the repository, add your project files to Git's staging area:

    git add .

    This command adds all files in the directory to Git. You can also add specific files by replacing the . with the filename, like git add file1.py.

3. Commit Your Changes

    Commit the changes to your local repository:

    After adding files, commit them to your repository with a message:

    git commit -m "Initial commit"

    This will save the snapshot of your project in Git.

4. Create a Remote GitHub Repository

    Create a new repository on GitHub:

    Go to GitHub, log in, and create a new repository. For this project, you could name it autoUpdateUbuntu (or anything relevant to your project).
        Click on the + icon in the top-right corner of GitHub and select New repository.
        Provide a repository name.
        Choose whether the repository will be public or private.
        Do not initialize with a README or a license (you already have those locally).
        Click Create repository.

5. Link Your Local Repository to GitHub

    Add the remote repository URL:

    Copy the SSH URL (e.g., git@github.com:yourusername/autoUpdateUbuntu.git) from the newly created GitHub repository page.

    In the terminal, link your local repository to GitHub by running:

    git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/autoUpdateUbuntu.git

    Replace yourusername with your GitHub username and autoUpdateUbuntu with the repository name you created.

6. Push Your Local Repository to GitHub

    Push the local repository to GitHub:

    Run the following command to push your files to GitHub:

git push -u origin main

If your default branch is master (old GitHub repositories), use:

    git push -u origin master

7. Verify the Repository

    Check the repository on GitHub:

    Go to your GitHub repository page, and you should see your files pushed there.
